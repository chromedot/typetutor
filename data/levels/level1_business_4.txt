Hello Team,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to request your input on the proposed changes to our weekly team meeting structure.

Several colleagues have suggested moving our Monday morning meetings to Wednesday afternoons to allow more focused time at the start of the week. This change would also accommodate those who work remotely on Mondays.

Please reply to this message with your preference and any scheduling conflicts you might have. We will implement the change that works best for the majority of the team.

Your feedback is important to us, and we want to ensure our meeting times support productivity and work-life balance for everyone.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Sincerely,
Team Coordinator
