Subject: Office Holiday Schedule

Dear Staff,

As we approach the end of the year, I would like to inform you of the upcoming holiday schedule for our office. We will be closed from December 24th through January 1st, reopening on January 2nd.

Please make sure to complete any urgent tasks before the break. If you have projects with external deadlines during this period, coordinate with your team lead to establish coverage arrangements.

Remote access will remain available for those who need to check emails or handle emergencies. However, we encourage everyone to take this time to rest and recharge with family and friends.

Looking forward to a successful year ahead.

Warm regards,
Human Resources
